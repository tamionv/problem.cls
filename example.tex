\maketitle

In order to solve the great \textfrak{Millenium Puzzle}, Yugi must first solve an incredibly difficult mathematical problem! Given two integers $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$, he must compute $\mathfrak{A} + \mathfrak{B}$. Unfortunately he spent all his time at school learning how to play card games, and doesn't know how to do this --- can you help him?

\section{Input data}

The only line of the input contains the two integers $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$.

\section{Output data}

Output $\mathfrak{A} + \mathfrak{B}$ on the first line of the output.

\begin{restrictions}[
\item $1 \leq \mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{B} \leq \np{1000000000}$.
]
\restr{50}{$1 \leq \mathfrak{A}, \mathfrak{B} \leq 1000$}
\restr{50}{No further restrictions.}
\end{restrictions}

\begin{examples}
\exmp{1 2}{3}%
\exmp{100 200}{300}%
\end{examples}
